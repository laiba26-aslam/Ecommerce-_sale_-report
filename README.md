E-Commerce Sales Dashboard: Turning Data into Business Insights
Problem Statement

####  Right now, most e-commerce reports are static and hard to explore. They don’t give business teams enough visibility into how sales, shipping, and product performance change over time.
#### Managers struggle to see which categories sell best, which states bring in the most orders, or where shipping delays happen. To solve this, we need an interactive Power BI dashboard that combines sales, category, and courier data — making it easier to spot patterns, track progress, and make informed business decisions.

Objective

The goal of this project is to build a dynamic and easy-to-use Power BI dashboard that gives a complete view of e-commerce sales performance.
It helps users:

Track overall sales, order quantities, and shipping performance.

Compare sales across channels like Amazon and Non-Amazon.

Monitor category-wise sales growth and monthly trends.

Analyze courier performance and delivery efficiency.

In short, the dashboard helps business teams make data-driven decisions that improve sales strategy, product management, and logistics.
